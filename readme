Welcome to Project TOSFBH! The mediocre student made split-screen chariot battle arena! 
Use a mouse to navigate the menus. Use an xbox one controller to control your chariot. 
Select the number of players in the player select screen, then move on to selecting the animal, 
chariot and weapon for each player and finally the map you want to do battle on.

the camera. To attack opponents get close to them on either side of you and hit left 
bumper to attack on the left side and right bumper to attack on the right side.
